## About
**Voxly** is a chat client similar to Discord/Guilded.gg; it's a passion project, nothing more — and there is no intention that it evolves into anything more. It is being built in an effort to explore the Go language, for which this repository—the backend—is built in.

This repository only holds the backend Go server, and not the frontend; that is...err, not built yet?! The plan is to build that in Angular, how exciting!
